*COMPANY* : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME* : G DEEPIKA

*INTERN ID*: CT6WQZA

*DOMAIN*: JAVA PROGRAMMING

*DURATION* : 6 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTHOSH


*DESCRIPTION*:

Core Functionalities:

The Java program will implement the following core functionalities:
Reading Text Files: The program should be able to read existing text files and display their content to the user. This functionality will involve:
Prompting the user to enter the file path or name.
Utilizing Java's FileReader or BufferedReader classes to open and read the file.
Handling potential IOExceptions like file not found or permission issues.
Displaying the file content in a user-friendly format, potentially with options for formatting or pagination for large files.
Writing to Text Files: The program should allow users to create new text files and write content to them. This will include:

Prompting the user for a file name or path and the content to be written.
Employing Java's FileWriter or BufferedWriter classes to create and write to the file.
Providing options for appending to an existing file or overwriting it.
Implementing error handling for potential issues like insufficient disk space or write permissions.
Modifying Text Files: The program should provide the capability to modify existing text files. This will encompass:
Allowing users to select a file to modify.
Reading the file content into memory for editing.
Providing a user interface for editing the text, potentially with features like search and replace or line manipulation.
Writing the modified content back to the file, overwriting the original content or saving a new version.
Implementing robust error handling and potentially backup mechanisms to prevent data loss.
Deliverable: A Script Demonstrating File Operations
The primary deliverable will be a well-documented Java script showcasing the implemented file operations. This script will:
Include clear comments: Explaining the purpose and functionality of each code segment.
Demonstrate error handling: Showing how the program gracefully handles potential exceptions.
Provide usage examples: Illustrating how to use the program to perform various file operations.
Be well-structured and readable: Adhering to Java coding conventions for maintainability.
Documentation:
The script will be accompanied by comprehensive documentation, covering:
Program Overview: A brief description of the program's purpose and functionalities.
Code Explanation: A detailed explanation of the code, including the classes used, methods implemented, and algorithms employed.
Usage Instructions: Clear instructions on how to compile and run the program, along with examples of how to use its features.
Error Handling: A description of the error handling mechanisms implemented in the program.
Potential Improvements: Suggestions for future enhancements or additions to the program.
Technical Considerations:
The program will be developed using Java and will utilize standard Java libraries for file handling. Considerations for efficiency and user experience will be taken into account during development. The program will aim to be cross-platform compatible, running on different operating systems with Java support.
This utility will provide a valuable tool for basic file management tasks and serve as an educational resource for learning about file operations in Java. The clear documentation and well-structured code will make it easy to understand, use, and extend for more advanced file handling needs.
